The library management system is a software application that is developed using the java based OSGI 
Framework. This system helps manage the day-to-day operations of a library. It is designed to provide 
library administrators and staff members with a set of tools to manage books, members, staff and 
generate reports efficiently. Here are the main components of the system,

  1. Staff Management: The staff management system allows library administrators to manage 
     information about the staff members who work in the library.
  2. Report Generation: The reporting functionality allows library administrators to get reports on 
     staff members and issued books.
  3. Book Management: The book management system allows library staff to add, edit, and delete 
     books from the library system. The system can also track the availability of each book.
  4. Member Management: The member management system allows library staff to add, edit, and 
     delete members from the system.
  5. Book Issue Management: The book issue management system allows library staff to check out 
     and check in books for members. The system can also manage late fees for overdue books.
